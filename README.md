This guide is for Staff and Faculty on how to add the IST Printer. If you would like to see extra printing information, please follow this link: https://cist.unomaha.edu/printing  
Note: YOU MUST BE INSIDE THE BUILDING ON AN ETHERNET CONNECTION OR ON THE VPN WHEN USING WIFI OR FROM OFF CAMPUS FOR THIS TO WORK

## 4/13/2021 UPDATE: Please Delete the ISTPrinter from your device if you have it. Most machines should get it auto-installed after removing the old printer! To remove the old printer, please open "Device and Printers" (Can also be found in Control Panel), right click "ISTPrinter" and choose "Remove Device/Uninstall Device" and reboot your machine. If this doesn't work, please follow the instructions below.

## Note: You may need the Windows driver for this printer if the printer doesn't function properly after these instructions. You can find the driver by going to https://business.sharpusa.com/product-downloads. You will need to set these options: "Product Category -> MFPs" "Product -> MX-7580N" "File Type -> Drivers and Utilities". Click "Search" and this should open a new page with your options and a list of drivers that you can choose from. You will need to download "Windows 64 Bit WHQL OS Driver Package" and install that driver. A reboot may also be required.

### Step 1
