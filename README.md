## 4/13/2021 UPDATE: Please Delete the ISTPrinter from your device if you have it. Most machines should get it auto-installed after removing the old printer! To remove the old printer, please open "Device and Printers" (Can also be found in Control Panel), right click "ISTPrinter" and choose "Remove Device/Uninstall Device" and reboot your machine. If this doesn't work, please follow the instructions below.
